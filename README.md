# **LE RESTAURANTEUR**

## This is the server side v1 API for Le Restauranteur.

#### Overview

Le Restauranteur is an app built with React by Spencer Dant. Using Le Restauranteur, a user can search their city or town in a simple and user-friendly design. Using this program as its engine, the app efficiently and without complication constructs a data set of local restaurants and eateries in the city or town the user searched and then, at random, presents an option for the user. If the user is not happy with that option, they can easily run their search again with the press of a button, and if they are, they can save that restaurant to their own user profile for future reference when they are looking for a place to go in that city or town again.

#### Using the API

The current version of this API is accessible only by using the built in search feature in Le Restauranteur, which can be found at https://le-restauranteur.herokuapp.com. 

The current version of this API is version 1, deployed in February of 2019.
